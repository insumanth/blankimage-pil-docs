# `--color COLOR`

Specify the color needed.

If the color-mode is given as `HEX`, you can provide hex string.
Eg:- `#FFFFFF` or `#A1234501`

For all other file formats, specify the color as number seperated by comma (`,`) for each channel.
The number of channels depends on color format and image format required.
